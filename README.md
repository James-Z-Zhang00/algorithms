# algorithms

Here I share my own study about algorithms as a part of my developer journey, hope it can be helpful to other people too.

1. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) Asymmetric Cryptographic Algorithm (Link to the project)
  * Repeat Square
  * Encryption & Decryption Implementation

2. 8-Puzzle Search Algorithm (Link to the project)
  * DFS: Depth First Search
  * BFS: Breadth First Search
  * Heuristic Value Search
